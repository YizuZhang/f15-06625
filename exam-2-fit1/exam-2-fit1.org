We are given some data that represents the initial stages of growth of cells in a reactor. You have reason to believe the following logistic growth equation could fit the data.

\(P = \frac{K}{1 + \exp(2.4 + r t)}\)

Find the parameters $K$ and $r$ and their confidence intervals. Prepare a plot that shows how well the model fits your data. Evaluate the quality of the fit and significance of the parameters.


#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from pycse import nlinfit

t = np.array([1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35])
P = np.array([2.8, 4.2, 3.5, 6.3, 15.7, 21.3, 23.7, 25.1, 25.8, 25.9])

def func(t,r,k): # define the model function with parameters.
    return k/(1+np.exp(2.4+r*t))
guess = [1.0,1.0]  # initial guess
p,pint,se = nlinfit(func,t,P,guess,0.05) # non linear fit
plt.plot(t,P,'ro')
tfit = np.linspace(min(t),max(t))
pfit = func(tfit,*p)
plt.plot(tfit,pfit)
print('K ={0},and its 95% confidence interval is {1}'.format(p[1],pint[1]))
print('r ={0},and its 95% confidence interval is {1}'.format(p[0],pint[0]))
plt.xlabel('t')
plt.ylabel('P')
plt.legend(['Data','Fit'],loc='best')
plt.savefig('figure1.png')
#[[./figure1.png]]
e = P-func(t,*p) # calculate the error between data and fit
plt.figure()
plt.plot(e)
plt.ylabel('Error')
plt.savefig('figure2.png')
#[[./figure2.png]]
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: K =25.5044147608,and its 95% confidence interval is [ 24.72207006  26.28675946]
: r =-0.274771519545,and its 95% confidence interval is [-0.29509085 -0.25445219]

From the figure we can see the data almost randomly located at different sides of the fit,and there's no obvious trend in the errors. So it is a good fit.
And the two parameters are not near 0, so they are significant in this model.
