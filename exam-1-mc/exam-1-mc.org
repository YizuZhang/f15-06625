* 185. Changing volumetric flow
  :PROPERTIES:
  :ID:       EBA077D5-1853-41F1-AB8D-CC9C7D535608
  :ANSWER:   b
  :END:

The gas-phase reaction $\ce{2A -> B}$ takes place in an isothermal, packed bed reactor with pressure drop. The volumetric flow rate at the reactor outlet will be ____________ at the reactor inlet.


[[mc:a]] higher than

[[mc:b]] lower than

[[mc:c]] the same as

[[mc:d]] insufficient information
# you chose b
* Under pressure
  :PROPERTIES:
  :ID:       084F0C49-6C3B-4FB9-AC97-C393BC39EAE8
  :ANSWER:   d
  :END:
For the gas-phase reaction 2A + B \rightarrow 3C, there is a reactor that reaches a conversion of 40%. If we replace the reactor with one that has a pressure drop in it (assuming everything else is the same), do you expect the conversion to:

[[mc:a]] increase

[[mc:b]] decrease

[[mc:c]] stay the same

[[mc:d]] not enough information to determine

  :PROPERTIES:
  :ID:       6C57972A-6E7E-4736-8307-383025543630
  :ANSWER:   c
  :END:

What are the units of a second order rate constant?

[[mc:a]]     mol / L / s

[[mc:b]]     1 / s

[[mc:c]]     L / mol / s

[[mc:d]]     (mol / L)**2 / s

* Who is right?
  :PROPERTIES:
  :ID:       0A038E5A-D801-462D-90DD-4520D5072192
  :ANSWER:   a
  :END:
Your company runs a reaction where the rate appears independent of concentration. You currently use a CSTR. A colleague suggests using a PFR with the same volume because it may increase conversion. You disagree. Who is right?

[[mc:a]]  You.

[[mc:b]]  Your colleague.

[[mc:c]]  Not enough information to tell.
