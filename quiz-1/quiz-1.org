[[mc:a]] sprintf("%1.3f", 2.0)

[[mc:b]] print("%1.3f".format(2.0))

[[mc:c]] print("{0:1.3f}".format(2.0))

For the reaction 2A + B \rightarrow 3C, there is a reactor that reaches a conversion of 40%. If we replace the reactor with one that has a pressure drop in it (assuming everything else is the same), do you expect the conversion to:

[[mc:a]] increase

[[mc:b]] decrease

[[mc:c]] stay the same

[[mc:d]] not enough information to determine
# you chose c
* PFR vs CSTR
  :PROPERTIES:

  :ANSWER:   a
  :END:
You are tasked with choosing between two reactors. We know the reaction is A goes to products, and it is first order in A. You can choose between a PFR and a CSTR and they are the same volume. Which one will give the highest conversion?

[[mc:a]] PFR

[[mc:b]] CSTR

[[mc:c]] They give the same conversion

[[mc:d]] not enough information to determine
# you chose b
# you chose a
# you chose b

  :ANSWER:   a
  :END:
The reaction A + B \rightarrow C is considered to be elementary. Which rate law is most appropriate?

[[mc:a]] r = k C_A C_B

[[mc:b]] r = k C_A^2

[[mc:c]] r = k C_A^{1/3} C_B^{2/3}

  :ANSWER:   c
  :END:

The units of the reaction rate are

[[mc:a]] mol/L

[[mc:b]] mol/min

[[mc:c]] mol/L/min
