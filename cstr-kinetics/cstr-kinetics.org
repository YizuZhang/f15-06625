The liquid-phase irreversible reaction $\ce{A -> B + C}$ was carried out in a CSTR. To learn the rate law, the residence time was varied by changing the volumetric flow. Pure A enters the reactor at a concentration of 2M. The steady state concentration of A was measured for the following residence times.

1. Determine the reaction rate law, and the values of the rate constant and reaction order, and confidence intervals on them.

#+RESULTS:
: The rate law is ra = 0.0099*Ca**2.9795
: 95% confidence intervals of alpha and k is [ 2.95081388  3.00815168] and [ 0.00966731  0.01004804]

[[elisp:(goto-char 1098)][(harithirumalai) line 31:]] although the question doesn't ask for a plot, you should plot fits, to see if they make sense. will help in exams.
