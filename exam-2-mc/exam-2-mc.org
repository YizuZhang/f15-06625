If a reaction has an equilibrium constant that is significantly large (KC >>1), which of the following statements can be made about the reaction?

[[mc:a]] The reaction will favor production of reactants.

[[mc:b]] The reaction will favor production of products.

[[mc:c]] The reaction will proceed quickly.

[[mc:d]] The reaction will proceed slowly.

[[mc:e]] Both the rate of reaction and extent of reaction can be determined from KC

Compare the following two reactions:
    I) N2O4(g) <--> 2 NO2(g)		 KC = 0.211
    II) CO(g) + Cl2(g) <--> COCl2 (g)	 KC = 4.57 x 10^9
Which of the following statements is correct?

[[mc:a]] Reaction I will proceed faster because KC is larger.

[[mc:b]] Reaction II will proceed faster because KC is larger.

[[mc:c]] Reaction I favors the production of products.

[[mc:d]] Reaction II favors the production of products.

[[mc:e]]  None of these statements is correct.

  :ANSWER:   b
  :END:

Consider the following reaction:
Br2(g) + heat <--> 2 Br(g)	 KC = 1.04 x 10^{-3} at 1285C
When the reaction is cooled down to room temperature, what happens to KC?

[[mc:a]] Changing the temperature doesnâ€™t change KC

[[mc:b]] KC will decrease because of the lower temperature

[[mc:c]] KC will decrease because the volume occupied by the gas becomes smaller

[[mc:d]] KC will increase because of the lower temperature.

[[mc:e]] KC will increase because the volume occupied by the gas becomes smaller

  :ANSWER:   e
  :END:

Consider the following reaction:
2 NO2Cl(g) --> 2NO2(g) + Cl2(g)	 KC = 0.558
If the volume of this equilibrium system is cut in half, what will happen to the equilibrium constant?

[[mc:a]] The new KC will be larger than the original because of a temperature increase.

[[mc:b]] The new KC will be larger than the original because the reaction shifts to the left.

[[mc:c]] The new KC will be smaller than the original because of a temperature increase.

[[mc:d]] The new KC will be smaller than the original because the reaction shifts to the left.

[[mc:e]] KC will stay the same.

  :ANSWER:   c
  :END:

Once a system reaches equilibrium:

[[mc:a]] The forward and reverse reactions no longer occur.

[[mc:b]] The forward and reverse reactions continue to occur and alter the concentrations of reactants and products.

[[mc:c]] The forward and reverse reactions occur, but do not alter the concentrations of the reactants or products.

[[mc:d]]  Only the forward reaction continues to occur.

[[mc:e]]  Only the reverse reaction continues to occur.
