Create your own problem on kinetic parameter estimation. You must use data from a scientific paper, and you must include a full citation for the paper in your solution. Your problem should use the estimated parameters in some kind of design problem. You must provide a full solution with an explanation the solution (similar to the solutions posted for other problems).

Problem: In reactor design for water treatment, the tamarind nut shell activated carbon (TNSAC) has been used to evaluate the performance for phosphate adsorption. The pseudo-first order equation of Lagergren is generally expressed as follows:[1]
$\frac{dq_t}{dt} = k_1(q_e-q_t)$
where $q_e$ and $q_t$ are the sorption capacity at equilibrium and at time $t$ and $k_1$ is the rate constant of pseudo-first order sorption.

The experimental data are listed as follows:[2]
t(min) = [0, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140]
Pt(mg/L) = [55.00, 35.04, 32.00, 25.80, 21.20, 14.48, 13.60, 4.40, 3.36, 3.20, 3.12, 2.60, 2.60]
Use the experimental data to solve for the rate constant and its 95% confidence interval.

t = np.array([0, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120]); #min
Pt = np.array([45.00, 40.80, 38.00, 37.00, 36.40, 35.00, 33.04, 32.40, 32.00, 31.60, 30.80, 30.80]);#mg/L

Ct = Pt/M #mmol/L

    return -k*(C-Ceq)

    C = odeint(dcdt, C0,t,args=(k,))
    return C[:,0]

print 'k = {0} at the 95% confidence level'.format(k_int)

#+RESULTS:
: The rate constant for pseudo-first order reaction is [ 0.13147619] 1/min
: k = [[ 0.06235118  0.20060121]] at the 95% confidence level
We can see this pseudo-first order reaction model fitting of experimental data is just a simple fitting and hence more models such as pseudo-second order has been put forward.
