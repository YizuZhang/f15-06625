Xylene exists in three isomers: ortho, meta and para-xylene. These isomers can be interconverted as follows:

O -> M       k1
M -> O       k2
O -> P       k3

Suppose an equimolar feed of O and M is fed at a total molar flow of 2 mol/min to a packed bed reactor with a total concentration of 2 mol/L. The packed bed reactor has 60 kg of catalyst in an ambient temperature heat exchanger with Ta = 500K, and a heat transfer constant of 16 J / min / degC / kgcat.

Additional information:
all heat capacities are 100 J / mol / K

dHrx1 = -1800 J / mol o-xylene
dHrx2 = -1100 J / mol o-xylene
k1 = 0.5 exp(2 * (1 - 320 / T))  L/kgcat/min
Kc = 10 exp (4.8 * (430/T - 1.5))
k2 = k1 / Kc
k3 = 0.005 exp(4.6*(1 - 460 / T)) L/kgcat/min

T0 = 330 K
Ta = 500 K
Ua = 16 J / kgcat / min / degC

Determine the maximum concentration of ortho-xylene in the reactor, and explain why there is a maximum.

#+RESULTS:

From the result we can see there's a maximum of A concentration in the reactor, it is about 0.85M
The maximum is because of the first consumption of o and then near the equrilibrium between o and m, this reaction is faster than the third reaction. Hence a peak comes here. But when time goes larger, the slow reaction that consumption of o becomes dominate and concentration goes down.
