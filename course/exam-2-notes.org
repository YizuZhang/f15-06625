C_X0 = 2.5 +/- 0.2 kmol/m^{3}

k = 30 +/- 5  (units are 1/min)

Y_{value} = $1.50 per kmol

Operating cost = $2.50 /min /m^{3}

reactor volume is 1.5 m^{3}


* in assignment:exam-2-mc

2 NO2Cl(g) --> 2NO2(g) + Cl2(g)	 KC = 0.558

should read

2 NO2Cl(g) <--> 2NO2(g) + Cl2(g)	 KC = 0.558

i.e. it is a reversible reaction
