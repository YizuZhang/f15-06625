* Nonisothermal reactors with reversible reactions

- The equilibrium conversion is usually the best we can hope for in a reactor for reversible reactions

- For endothermic reactions, the equilibrium conversion increases with /increasing/ temperature
  - But an adiabatic reactor will decrease in temperature with increasing conversion

- For an exothermic reaction the equilibrium conversion increases with /decreasing/ temperature
  - But an adiabatic reactor will increase in temperature with increasing conversion

- Let us illustrate the issues with a simple example

# Adapted from example 8-6 in Fogler
- Consider $A \leftrightharpoons B$ with $\Delta H_{rx} = -20$ kcal / mol

- Let the heat capacity of $A$ and $B$ be 50 cal / mol / K

- The equilibrium constant is 100,000 at 298 K

- Pure A is fed to an adiabatic CSTR

- First, we consider the equilibrium conversion that is possible

- From thermodynamics, and assuming ideal behavior we have
\( K = \frac{a_B}{a_A} = \frac{C_B}{C_A} \)

- We use fractional conversion to define $C_A$ and $C_B$
\begin{align*}
C_A = C_{A0}(1 - X_{eq}) \\
C_B = C_{A0} X_{eq}
\end{align*}

- Plugging those into the equilibrium equation and solving for $X_{eq}$ leads to:
\( X_{eq} = \frac{K(T)}{1 + K(T)} \)

  - Where we recall that $K$ is a function of $T$:

$K(T) = K(T_0) \exp \left[\frac{-\Delta H_{rx}(T_0)}{R}\left (\frac{1}{T}-\frac{1}{T_0}\right)\right]$

- Now we can plot the equilibrium conversion as a function of reactor temperature

- Not surprisingly, at low temperature  the possibility for nearly complete conversion exists

- Now, we consider the adiabatic CSTR energy balance

\(0 = \sum F_{j0} C_{p,j} (T_{feed} - T) - \Delta H_{rx}(T) r V\)

- From the mole balance

\(0 = F_{A0} - F_{A} + \alpha_{A} r V\)

  - We find that $r V = (F_A - F_{A0}) / \alpha_A = F_{A0} X$

- So we have
\(X = \frac{C_{pA}(Tfeed - T)}{\Delta H_{rx}}\)

  - Not that if $\Delta H_{rx}$ and $C_{pA}$ do not depend strongly on $T$ this function is linear in $T$

- Let us consider that function in conjunction with the equilibrium conversion

- We have to specify a feed temperature, let us consider 300, 400 and 500 K

- Clearly you want the lowest feed temperature to get the highest conversion

- We cannot say yet what the actual conversion will be
  - It will be on the energy balance line, and less than the equilibrium conversion
  - The actual conversion depends on the kinetics and feed conditions


- We will calculate the exit temperature and conversion as a function of feed temperature

- At a low feed temperature the possible equilibrium conversion may be high, but the kinetics will be slow limiting actual conversion

- At a high feed temperature the kinetics will be very fast, but the equilibrium conversion will be low

- This suggests an optimal feed temperature that maximizes the exit conversion

- We reconsider the example of $A \leftrightharpoons B$ that we considered before.

- Now, we solve the mole and energy balances simultaneously as a function of feed temperature

- You can see that the optimal feed temperature is at about 470 K with a maximum conversion of 0.1.
  - Note: this problem is very sensitive to the values of the rate constant.

- Below that the exit conversion is limited by slow kinetics

- Above that reaction is limited by the equilibrium conversion

- As temperature increases the exit conversion approaches the equilibrium conversion

- To exceed the adiabatic limit you must use a series of reactors with intercooling
  - The exit of one reactor will be cooled and then feed into the next reactor

- Let us consider this example

[[./images/series-cstr-intercooling.png]]

- We will consider a fixed feed temperature of 300 K
- After the first reactor we cool the stream back to 300 K

- By using interstage cooling we are able to increase the total conversion
- An alternative to this is integrating a heat exchanger to keep the reactor isothermal

* Multiple reactions in nonisothermal reactor design

- The critical point to remember with multiple reactions is we must consider the heat generated from multiple reactions

** Multiple reactions in a nonisothermal CSTR

- For the CSTR the energy balance is

\begin{equation}
\sum N_i C_{p,i} \frac{dT}{dt} = \sum F_i C_{p,i}(T_0 - T) + \sum (-\Delta H_{rx,j}) r_j V + \dot{Q} + \dot{W}_s
\end{equation}


- We consider a series reaction $A \rightarrow B \rightarrow C$ in a CSTR

#+ATTR_ORG: :width 300
[[./images/cstr-multi-reactions-heat-exchange.png]]
- It is unclear from the problem setup how many solutions there could be

- Our analysis suggests up to five possible steady state solutions

- Only three of these are likely to be stable solutions

- If you derive expressions for the heat generated and removed from this reactor you can see why
  - And that you would expect 5 steady state solutions

- A final note is that \tau in this case is equal to 0.01
  - That is very short!
  - A larger \tau would likely result in a single steady state solution

** Multiple reactions in a plug-flow reactor

- The energy balance for multiple reactions changes only in that we have more species to consider, and we have reaction enthalpies from multiple reactions

- For the plug flow reactor this leads to

\(\frac{dT}{dV} = \frac{\dot{Q} +  \sum (-\Delta H_{rxn,i}(T) r_i) }{\sum F_j C_{p,j}} \)

- We consider the parallel reactions
\begin{align*}
A \rightarrow B \\
2A \rightarrow C
\end{align*}

- The two reactions are both exothermic and have elementary rate laws

- We consider a PFR with an ambient temperature heat exchanger that will cool the reactor

[[./images/pfr-multi-heat-exchanger.png]]

- We want to know the temperature profile in the reactor, and the exit molar flow of each species
