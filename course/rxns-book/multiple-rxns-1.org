* Multiple reactions

** Stoichiometry in multiple reactions

-   When we have multiple reactions, e.g.

1. A \rightarrow 2B
2. B \rightarrow C

- We have a scenario where a species maybe consumed and/or generated by multiple reactions.

- We can define a reaction extent \xi_j for each reaction.
- Then for each species we can determine the change in moles from all the reactions as:

\(n_i = n_{i0} + \sum_j \alpha_{ij}\xi_j \)

where $\alpha_{ij}$ is the stoichiometric coefficient of species $i$ in reaction $j$.

Consider \xi_1=0.5 and \xi_2=0.25, and an initial moles of species B of 0.75 moles.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
N_B0 = 0.75
xi1 = 0.5
xi2 = 0.25

alpha_B1 = +2
alpha_B2 = -1

n_B = N_B0 + xi1 * alpha_B1 + xi2 * alpha_B2
print('There are now {} moles of B'.format(n_B))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: There are now 1.5 moles of B

- Does that make sense?

- A slightly more compact way to write this using linear algebra.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np
N_B0 = 0.75
xi = [0.5, 0.25]
alpha = [2, -1]

n_B = N_B0 + np.dot(xi, alpha)
print('There are now {} moles of B'.format(n_B))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: There are now 1.5 moles of B

** Rates for multiple reactions

-   When we have multiple reactions, e.g.

1. A \rightarrow 2B
2. B \rightarrow C

we have a scenario where a species maybe consumed and/or generated by multiple reactions.

- Each reaction will have its own reaction rate. We denote the rate of reaction $i$ as $r_i$.

- In this example, we might have $r_1 = k_1 C_A$, and $r_2 = k_2 C_B$.

- Then we have from reaction 1 that the rate of production of B is $r_{1,B} = 2 r_1$ and the rate of consumption in reaction two is $r_{2,B} = -r_2$.

- The net rate of production of species B is the sum of these two species specific rates.

\( r_B = 2 r_{1,B} + r_{2,b} \)

\( r_B = 2 r_1 - r_2 \)

- This is the expression we would use in a species mole balance. For example, in a constant volume batch reactor we would have:

\( \frac{dN_B}{dt} = V r_B \)

In this example you also need another mole balance on species A.

- Critical points
  + We need rate laws for each reaction
  + You derive the species rates using stoichiometry for each reaction
  + You add all the species rates together to get the net rate of reaction for the species

- Let us work out this example completely. Let us consider a constant volume batch reactor.

    Ca, Cb = C
    r1 = k1 * Ca
    r2 = k2 * Cb

    ra = -r1
    r1b = 2 * r1
    r2b = -r2
    rb = r1b + r2b

    dCadt = ra
    dCbdt = rb

    return [dCadt, dCbdt]

- You can see here that A continuously disappears. A is only consumed in the first reaction.

- Initially, B increases as it is produced by the first reaction. However, it begins to be consumed by reaction two, and eventually is completely consumed.
- If B was the desired product, you could maximize the yield by stopping the reaction after a short time.

** Reversible chemical reactions

- Reversible reactions are a special case of multiple reactions. We consider a forward and reverse reaction.

- For example, in the water gas shift reaction we could write the forward reaction as:

$CO + H_2O \rightarrow H_2 + CO_2$

and the reverse reaction as:

$H_2 + CO_2 \rightarrow CO + H_2O$

We write this as $CO + H_2O \rightleftharpoons H_2 + CO_2$.

- All reactions are to some extent reversible

\( \alpha A + b B + \cdots \rightleftharpoons q Q + s S + \cdots \)

- Thermodynamics defines the equilibrium distribution of reactants and products

\( \frac{a_Q^q a_S^s}{a_A^{\alpha} a_B^b} = K_{eq} =  e^{-\Delta G / RT} \)

where $\Delta G$ is the reaction Gibbs free energy defined by $\Delta G = \sum_j \alpha_j G_j$

- $a_A^{\alpha}$ is the activity of species $A$ raised to the \alpha power. It is common to use concentration instead of activity, but you must remember this implies ideal activity, and that the equilibrium constant may end up having units.

- Recall that activity is dimensionless

- We sometimes express activity in terms of concentration using activity coefficients
  + $a_j = \gamma_j C_j$
  + For ideal solutions, \gamma_j = 1

*** A brief worked example.

- The water gas shift reaction \(H_2O + CO \rightleftharpoons CO_2 + H_2 \) has a Gibbs reaction energy of -730 cal/mol at 1000K.

- If you start with equimolar amounts of water and carbon monoxide at a total pressure of 10 atm, what is the equilibrium composition of gases in mol/L?

- There is no change in the number of moles for the reaction, the temperature is constant, and thus the volume is constant.

- We essentially only need to find the equilibrium extent of reaction, and the problem is solved. We know in this case that $C_j = C_{j,0} + \alpha_j \xi$. At equilibrium,  we will have:

\( K = \frac{C_{C,eq} C_{D,eq}}{C_{A,eq} C_{B,eq}} = \frac{(C_{C,0} + \alpha_C \xi_{eq}) (C_{D,0} + \alpha_D \xi_{eq}) }{(C_{A,0} + \alpha_A \xi_{eq}) (C_{B,0} + \alpha_B \xi_{eq})} \)

- After simplification, we have:

\( K = \frac{\xi_{eq}^2}{(C_{A,0} - \xi_{eq})^2} \)

- So, we simply evaluate $K$ for the conditions, and then solve for $\xi_{eq}$.

- Let $C_{A0}$ = the concentration of A and B initially in the reactor. $C_{A0} = P_{A0} / (RT)$.

- An alternative formulation that uses the linear algebra notation follows. The advantage of this approach is that we do not need to derive the equation to solve, it is simply the definition of the equilibrium constant.  The code, on the other hand, is a little more verbose, while simultaneously being more explicit.

- We get the same result as before.

*** Temperature dependent equilibrium constants

- We defined the equilibrium constant as $K = e^{-\Delta G /(RT)}$.

- Thus, the equilibrium constant is temperature dependent because of the $T$ in the denominator of the exponential.

- It is /also/ temperature dependent because $\Delta G$ is temperature dependent.

- To incorporate the temperature dependence of the Gibbs free energy of a reaction, we need to compute the temperature dependence.

- The [[http://webbook.nist.gov/chemistry/][NIST Webbook]] provides data about a large number of compounds which can be used to compute reaction energies.

- Let us consider CO.

- At http://webbook.nist.gov/cgi/cbook.cgi?ID=C630080&Units=SI&Mask=1#Thermo-Gas you will find the data needed to compute the Gibbs free energy of CO at arbitrary temperature and standard pressure.
  + You will find the standard heat of formation and entropy,
  + coefficients of the Shomate polynomials which are used to calculate the enthalpy and entropy at non-standard temperatures.

- The Shomate polynomials are polynomials in $t = T/1000$.


\(H = H_{F, 298.15} + A t + B t^2/2 + C t^3/3 + D t^4/4 - E/t + F - H \)

\(S = A \ln(t) + B t + C t^2/2 + D t^3/3 - E/(2 t^2) + G\)

- With this information, we can calculate $G$ for CO at any temperature: \( G = H - T S \). If we have this information for all of the species, then we can compute the reaction energy at any temperature.

- You can see here that lower temperatures make the reaction much more exothermic.
- The equilibrium constant would be considerably larger, and the products more favored at the lower temperature.

*** Another view of chemical equilibrium

- The composition at chemical equilibrium is the one that minimizes the Gibbs free energy of the mixture.

- We can use the data for computing the Gibbs free energy of pure components to illustrate this.

- We have to compute the Gibbs free energy of a species in the mixture, which is easy if we can assume an ideal mixture. Then we have

$G_j =  G_{j0} + R T \log(x_j  P / P_0)$.

- Here we will show that there is a reaction extent that minimizes the Gibbs free energy of the mixture.

*** Equilibria with multiple reactions

- We use the same fundamental approaches to solving equilibrium problems when there are multiple reactions
 + In fact, we do not need to consider reactions at all if we know the Gibbs free energies of each species

- Let us consider this set of reactions, where all species are in the gas phase. Assume we start with equimolar amounts of A and B, and a total pressure of 2.5 atm at 400 K.

1. \(A + B \rightleftharpoons C\) with K_1 = 108
2. \(A + B \rightleftharpoons D \) with K_2 = 284

We want to know what the equilibrium composition for these reactions are.

We have two equations:
\(K_1 = \frac{a_C}{a_A a_B} \)

and

\(K_2 = \frac{a_D}{a_A a_B} \)

- We know the activity of a gas species is $a_j = P_j / 1 atm$ or equivalently in mole fraction: $a_j = x_j P / 1 atm$.

- We define reaction extents for each reaction: \xi_1 and \xi_2

- Then:
\begin{align}
n_A = n_{A0} - \xi_1 - \xi_2 \\
n_B = n_{B0} - \xi_1 - \xi_2 \\
n_C = \xi_1  \\
n_D = \xi_2 \\
n_{total} = n_{t0} - \xi_1 - \xi_2
\end{align}

- We can define mole fractions from these equations which allow us to express the equilibrium equations in two unknowns.

- It is convenient to normalize all equations by $n_{t0}$, which leads to these definitions for the mole fractions:

\begin{align}
y_A = \frac{y_{A0} - \xi_1' - \xi_2'}{1 - \xi_1' - \xi_2'} \\

- These are plugged into the activity $a_j = y_j P / 1 atm$.

Here is the code we use to solve this problem.

#+RESULTS:
: The reaction extents are:
: [ 0.13335692  0.35067931]
: The mole fractions are:
: [0.030939713802784111, 0.030939713802784111, 0.25846179035362588, 0.6796587820408061]

- There are significant amounts of each product

- Note that other initial guesses give unphysical solutions, i.e. negative mole fractions.

- Also note that this solution applies to a /constant total pressure/ which means in this case the volume must be changing since there is a change in the number of moles
  + You would get a different result in a constant volume reactor where the total pressure changes

- There is a constraint on the two reaction extents.
  + since no mole fraction can be negative, $\xi_1' + \xi_2' \le y_{A0}$
  + Other solutions violate this constraint
  + You may have to use constrained optimization to find physical solutions


*** Gibbs energy constrained minimization and the NIST webbook	   :optional:

- We used the NIST webbook to compute a temperature dependent Gibbs energy of reaction, and then used a reaction extent variable to compute the equilibrium concentrations of each species for the water gas shift reaction.

- Here we look at the direct minimization of the Gibbs free energy of the species, with no assumptions about stoichiometry of reactions. We only apply the constraint of conservation of atoms. We use the NIST Webbook to provide the data for the Gibbs energy of each species.

- As a reminder we consider equilibrium between the species $CO$, $H_2O$, $CO_2$ and $H_2$, at 1000K, and 10 atm total pressure with an initial equimolar molar flow rate of $CO$ and $H_2O$.

**** Compute mole fractions and partial pressures

- The pressures here are in good agreement with the pressures found by other methods. The minor disagreement (in the third or fourth decimal place) is likely due to convergence tolerances in the different algorithms used.

**** Computing equilibrium constants

- We can compute the equilibrium constant for the reaction $CO + H_2O \rightleftharpoons CO_2 + H_2$.

- Compared to the value of K = 1.44 we found previously, the agreement is excellent.

- Note, that to define an equilibrium constant it is necessary to specify a reaction, even though it is not necessary to even consider a reaction to obtain the equilibrium distribution of species!
