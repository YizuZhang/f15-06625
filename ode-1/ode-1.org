Consider this differential equation.

\(F_{A0} \frac{dX}{dV} = k (C_{A0} (1 - X))^2\)

It is given that k = 0.05, C_{A0} = 2.5, and F_{A0} = 5, and V stands for volume, and it is the independent variable. It is also given that X(V=0) = 0.

1. Use Python to integrate the differential equation and plot the solution. Include the figure in this homework.

2. Determine the volume required to reach a value of X of 0.9.

#To get the exact answer for this question. We can use quad to integrate the differential equations and then use fsolve to solve it.
