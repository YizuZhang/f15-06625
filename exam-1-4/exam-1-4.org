The following reaction \ce{A \rightarrow B} occurs in a CSTR. The feed concentration is 6 mol/L, the feed rate is 3 L/min, and the volume of the reactor is 5.5 L. The rate law is given as \(r_A = \frac{-25 C_A}{2 + C_A + 5 Ca^2}\) with overall units of mol / L / min.

The mole balance for this reactor can be expressed as:

\( \nu/V (C_{A0} - C_A) = -r_A\)

1. Plot the left hand and right hand sides of the equation above as a function of concentration over the range of 0 to 6L. Comment on what you observe and what it means.

2. Quantitatively estimate the exit conversion of A. Discuss your solution.

this rate law of reaction may lead to multiple stead state in this reactor.
and the finally conversion may be different because of the different initial concentration.
