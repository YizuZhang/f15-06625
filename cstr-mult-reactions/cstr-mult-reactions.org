The reactions

\begin{align}
A + B \rightarrow C \\
A + C \rightarrow D
\end{align}

take place in a CSTR. It is known that $r_1 = 14.19 C_A C_B$
kmol/m$^3$/ksec and $r_2=2.31 C_A C_C$ kmol/m$^3$/ksec. A is fed at 40
kmol/ksec and B is fed at 20 kmol/ksec at an overall volumetric flow
of 5 m$^3$/ksec. Show graphically if there is an optimal volume that
maximizes the exit concentration of C. Explain your answer.

# These two reaction take place in the reactor and C is generated first reaction and consumed second reaction.
# The residence time elongates as  volume becomes larger. When residence time is relatively small, generating is dominant and when residence time is large, comusing is dominant. So there's a optimal volume for a maximium C concentration.
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: The optimal volume is 0.20 L
