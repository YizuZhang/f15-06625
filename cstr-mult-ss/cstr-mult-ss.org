Consider the reaction: $A \rightarrow products$ with the rate law $-r_A =
\frac{1.75 C_A}{(1 + 10 C_A)^2}$. In class, we observed the possibility of
multiple steady states depending on the reaction and reactor
conditions. Assuming that $\nu = 0.15$ L/min with the inlet concentration of
$C_A = 1.5$ mol/L and the CSTR volume is $V = 5$ L, plot the transient
concentration of A out to steady state conditions of the CSTR reactor for
different initial conditions of $C_A(t=0) = 0 to 1.5$. Explain qualitatively why
you get two different answers.

From this output result we can clearly see that there are actually two steady state concentration concerning different initial concentration of A.
We initial concentration is less than 0.2 mol/L, steady concentration is around 0.8 mol/L, while when initial concentration is more than 0.2 mol/L, finally the concentration of A reaches around 1.1 mol/L.
This two results can be explained as follows.
As for the $-r_A =\frac{1.75 C_A}{(1 + 10 C_A)^2}$, we can qualitatively figure out this leads to three roots of dNa/dt = 0 and the middle one is actually not stable because a disturb will cause deviation .
When initial concentration is low, the reaction rate is large, in this condition, inlet A is consumed and concentration of A will be maintained as low and reach steady state.
However, when initial concentration is high enough, the reaction rate drops, hence A flowing in cannot been consumed to the low concentration. The higher concentration steady state emerged.
