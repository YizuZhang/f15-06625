Solve the following equation for X. This equation comes from a reactor design problem, and X is the conversion. Use scipy.optimize.fsolve to get your answer.

\(1 - 2X + X^2 = \frac{F_{A0}}{k C^2_{A0} V} X\)

FA0 = 10
k = 8.447
CA0 = 1.0
V = 200

Make a plot that shows your answer is correct.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import fsolve
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

Fa0 = 10.0
k = 8.447
Ca0 = 1.0
V = 200.0


def func1(X):
    return 1-2*X+X**2
def func2(X):
    return Fa0*X/(k*V*Ca0**2)
def fsol(X):
    return func1(X) - func2(X)  # define fsol = func1 - func2 to use fsolve to find solution.
guess = 0.5
ans, = fsolve(fsol,guess)
print ('The solution is x ={0:.4f}'.format(ans))
Xspan = np.linspace(0,1)
plt.plot(Xspan,func1(Xspan))
plt.plot(Xspan,func2(Xspan))
plt.legend(['func1','func2'],loc = 'best')
plt.xlabel('X')
plt.ylabel('func1 or func2')
plt.savefig('figure.png')
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: The solution is x =0.9260

[[file:figure.png]]
#+RESULTS:
: The solution is x =0.9260

From the figure we can see func1 and func2 intersect at around x = 0.9, that's where the solution is, so the solution of fsolve might be reasonable.
