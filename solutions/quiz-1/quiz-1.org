Which command will print 2.000 in Python?

[[mc:a]] sprintf("%1.3f", 2.0)

[[mc:b]] print("%1.3f".format(2.0))

[[mc:c]] print("{0:1.3f}".format(2.0))

[[mc:d]] sprint("{0:3.1f}".format(2.0))

  :ANSWER:   b
  :END:
For the reaction 2A + B \rightarrow 3C, there is a reactor that reaches a conversion of 40%. If we replace the reactor with one that has a pressure drop in it (assuming everything else is the same), do you expect the conversion to:

[[mc:a]] increase

[[mc:b]] decrease

[[mc:c]] stay the same

[[mc:d]] not enough information to determine

There is no mole change, so the volumetric flow will increase, decreasing the residence time in the reactor.

* PFR vs CSTR
  :PROPERTIES:

  :ANSWER:   a
  :END:
You are tasked with choosing between two reactors. We know the reaction is A goes to products, and it is first order in A. You can choose between a PFR and a CSTR and they are the same volume. Which one will give the highest conversion?

[[mc:a]] PFR

[[mc:b]] CSTR

[[mc:c]] They give the same conversion

[[mc:d]] not enough information to determine

PFRs always give higher conversion for positive order reactions.

* Elementary, dear Watson
  :PROPERTIES:
  :ID:       323A4DCF-5F34-467C-89D6-889A784FF1DB
  :ANSWER:   False
  :END:

The reaction H_2 + 1/2 O_2 \rightarrow H2O is elementary.

[[mc:True]]

[[mc:False]]

[[mc:Neither]]

To make water you have to break an H2 bond, an O2 bond, and make two OH bonds, and this cannot happen in a single step. Also the non-integer stoichiometry suggests it is not elementary.

  :ANSWER:   a
  :END:
The reaction A + B \rightarrow C is considered to be elementary. Which rate law is most appropriate?

[[mc:a]] r = k C_A C_B

[[mc:b]] r = k C_A^2

[[mc:c]] r = k C_A^{1/3} C_B^{2/3}

* Units
  :PROPERTIES:
  :ID:       7CC4390C-105C-42C1-98E2-ABC01891E46D
  :ANSWER:   c
  :END:

The units of the reaction rate are

[[mc:a]] mol/L

[[mc:b]] mol/min

[[mc:c]] mol/L/min
