The irreversible reaction $A \rightarrow B + C$ is carried out adiabatically in a 500 L PFR. Species A is fed to the reactor at a rate of 10 mol/min and a pressure of 2 atm. An inert stream is also fed to the reactor at a pressure of 2 atm. The temperature of both entrance streams is 1100K.

a. Plot the exit conversion for a range of inert molar flows from 0 to 100 mol/min. Explain why there is a maximum in conversion.

Additional information
k = exp(34.3 - 34,222/T)  1/min
CP,A=170 J/mol/K
CP,B=90 J/mol/K
CP,C=80 J/mol/K
CP,I=200 J/mol/K
Hrxn=80 kJ/mol

** eb-inerts solution
Some key points to this solution are:
1. there is a change in number of moles, and we have to consider that and the temperature dependence of the volumetric flow.

2. we need a mole balance on each species for the energy balance

3. we need to consider the inerts in the energy balance.

The conversion goes up initially because the inerts provide heat to the endothermic reaction. The conversion eventually goes down because of dilution, and decreased space time due to the increasing flow rate.
