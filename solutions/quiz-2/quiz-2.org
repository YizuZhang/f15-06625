Solve the following equation for X. This equation comes from a reactor design problem, and X is the conversion. Use scipy.optimize.fsolve to get your answer.

\(1 - 2X + X^2 = \frac{F_{A0}}{k C^2_{A0} V} X\)

FA0 = 10
k = 8.447
CA0 = 1.0
V = 200

Make a plot that shows your answer is correct.

* Solution
We can reframe the problem so it is easy to use fsolve as follows:

Find the value of X that satisfies

\(0 = 1 - 2X + X^2 - \frac{F_{A0}}{k C^2_{A0} V} X\)

Here is the solution with the plot.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
from scipy.optimize import fsolve
import numpy as np

FA0 = 10
k = 8.447
CA0 = 1.0
V = 200

def objective(X):
    z = 1 - 2 * X + X**2 - FA0 / k / CA0**2 / V * X
    return z

ans1, = fsolve(objective, 0.99)
ans2, = fsolve(objective, 1.1)
print('The answers are: {}'.format([ans1, ans2]))

Xspan = np.linspace(0.8, 1.1)

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot(Xspan, objective(Xspan))
plt.plot(Xspan, 0 * Xspan, 'r-')
plt.plot([ans1], [0],'ko')
plt.xlabel('X')
plt.ylabel('objective(X)')
plt.savefig('plt.png')

: The answers are: [0.92596599005845714, 1.0799532712178321]

You can see that there are two answers, which you might have suspected from the second-order polynomial nature of the objective function. We plotted a black dot on one solution, which shows the objective function is actually zero at that point. In the real reaction engineering problem, X is the conversion, and only one of the solutions (the one less than one) is correct. The other one is unphysical.
