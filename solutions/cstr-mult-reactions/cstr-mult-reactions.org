The reactions

\begin{align}
A + B \rightarrow C \\
A + C \rightarrow D
\end{align}

take place in a CSTR. It is known that $r_1 = 14.19 C_A C_B$
kmol/m$^3$/ksec and $r_2=2.31 C_A C_C$ kmol/m$^3$/ksec. A is fed at 40
kmol/ksec and B is fed at 20 kmol/ksec at an overall volumetric flow
of 5 m$^3$/ksec. Show graphically if there is an optimal volume that
maximizes the exit concentration of C. Explain your answer.

* Solution
The key to this solution is solving the the CSTR mole balance for many volumes over a range that shows if there is a maximum. We expect there to be a maximum because C is essentially in a series reaction where it is produced in reaction 1 and consumed in reaction 2. So there should be some optimal volume that maximizes the concentration.

We use a parameterized objective function to solve this problem, and loop through volumes to get a solution for each volume. Since we have a fixed volumetric flow, we actually decide to define a range of space times, and compute the volume for each time.
