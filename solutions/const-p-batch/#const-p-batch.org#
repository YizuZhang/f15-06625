The reaction $A \rightarrow 2B$ occurs in a constant pressure batch
reactor.  Assuming the kinetics are described by $r = k C_A^2$, $k =
2.3$ L/mol/s, that the initial pressure is 1 atm, there are intially
10.0 moles of A in the reactor at 298K, plot the concentration of $A$
and the volume of the reactor as a function of time from 0 to 2000
seconds. Finally, compute the ratio of the volume at 2000 seconds to
the initial volume and comment on whether it makes sense.

* solution
With constant pressure, the volume of the reactor will change. We have to use the ideal gas law to determine the volume, which changes as the total number moles change. The moles are increasing, so the volume should increase. With complete conversion, we expect the volume to double.

We have to use a mole balance here, and compute the concentration for the rate laws. Here is our solution.
